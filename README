Neurology v0.0 (Jared Nance)

Depends in a big way on the Boost Graph Library available from www.boost.org.
In order to compile, the compiler needs to know where the boost include directory
is where the BGL and Random Number Generation facilities sit.  This should be 
something like
	/usr/local/include/boost-1_38
or similar.

Also, angle bracket includes are used, so that -I. needs to be passed to the
compiler as well.  There is really no good reason for this other than that
I like the continuity.

Enjoy!
